# Execution Status

**Current phase:** Phase 6 backend complete and merged; web pages for Phases 3–6 in progress, then Phase 7.
**Last completed tasks (2026-10-17):**
- Phase 6 backend:
  - dashboard (permission-gated blocks, branch scope, own-only for reps);
  - reports for inventory valuation and aging, sales profitability (from the ledger, grouped
    by salesperson, branch, source, payment type or month), lead conversion, cash flow, and
    receivables and installment aging, each reconciled to the ledger on company-wide runs;
  - CSV, XLSX and PDF exports with the same column policy, audited.
- Costs posted after a sale now carry the sale dimension, so profitability includes them.
- Phase 3 web pages for purchasing, costs, work orders and approvals are committed (ece9eb3).
- Full API suite: 26 files, 291 tests passing. Shared: 46 passing.

**In progress (background agents; partial work is saved on disk):**
- Phase 3/4 web workflow `wf_c6e05060-0fb` (script
  `phase3-4-web-wf_5d942e13-d19.js`, resumable). It is building cash/expenses/accounting,
  customers/leads/notifications, appointments/reservations/receivables and wishes/employees.
- The Phase 5 web agent (sandbox j) is building sales, installments, commissions and cash
  closing.

**Exact next tasks:**
1. Review, fix and commit each finished web feature (tsc, eslint, look at the screenshots).
2. Phase 6 web: dashboard page and a reports page (generic `ReportResult` table, filters,
   export buttons).
3. Phase 7: digital showroom and integration adapters.

## Phase 1 — delivered
- pnpm workspace: `packages/shared`, `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `e2e`.
- DB: migrations `0000_foundation`, `0001_foundation_security` (RLS on all tenant tables, audit hash chain
  trigger, immutable + balanced ledger triggers, gapless numbering function, narrow SECURITY DEFINER helpers).
- API: sessions (hashed tokens, idle+absolute expiry), CSRF (session-bound token + Origin check), argon2id,
  lockout, rate limits, RBAC guard (deny-by-default), per-request tenant transaction, idempotency interceptor,
  provisioning, users/roles/branches/company settings, audit list/verify, health endpoints, OpenAPI at /api/docs.
- Web: design system (light/dark, RTL/LTR), login, company selection, account, platform admin, settings pages.
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (not yet observed running on GitHub).

## Phase 2 — delivered
- Migrations 0002/0003: vehicles + catalog (global/tenant RLS), history tables (append-only grants),
  media/documents, inspections (completed = immutable via trigger), transfers, stock counts, trigram search;
  seeded 39 makes / 164 models / 53 features / default inspection template.
- API: Vehicle CRUD (optimistic locking, market-aware VIN rules), lifecycle transitions through one locked entry
  point, pricing with floor permission + history, odometer readings with correction rule, features, media
  (sniffed types, GPS/XMP scrub, primary/public/order), documents (sensitive filtering), inspections (template
  snapshot, required items, completion), transfers (in-transit blocking, destination receipt), stock counts
  (scan/submit/reconcile with write-off), catalog, permission-checked file downloads.
- Web: vehicle grid/table list with filters, sectioned form, Vehicle 360 page with tabs and action modals,
  inspection page with interactive SVG body diagram (colour + letter codes), transfers, stock counts.

## Phase 3 — delivered so far
- Migrations 0004/0005:
  - tables: suppliers, cost categories (25 seeded), acquisitions, vehicle costs, cash accounts, cash
    transactions (append-only), supplier payments with allocations (append-only), expenses, work
    orders and items, approval requests;
  - RLS on all of them;
  - DELETE revoked on financial documents;
  - posted-amount guard triggers.
- FinanceModule (global):
  - CashService: cash book and GL together; transfers and transfer reversal; closed-day hook.
  - CashAccountsService: opening balance against equity (3000).
  - PayablesService.
  - SupplierPaymentsService: exact allocation, no overpayment, void.
  - ApprovalsService: inbox, exact counts, maker-checker guard.
- PurchasingModule:
  - suppliers 360, duplicate check, GL statement;
  - acquisitions: draft → submit → approve/reject → cancel, with pay-on-approval;
  - cost engine: approve, reject, reverse, shared-cost allocation, costs posted after a sale go to
    COGS, summary with expected profit;
  - open payables, and aging reconciled to GL 2000.
- ExpensesModule: post, approve, reject, reverse, pay-now, summaries.
- WorkOrdersModule: approved items become posted costs, exactly once.
- AccountingModule:
  - transfers and reversal, cash book;
  - chart, trial balance, journal, account statement;
  - income statement and balance sheet;
  - reconciliation of cash vs 1100, inventory vs 1300, AP vs 2000.
- B-016 decided conservatively: the creator or submitter cannot approve their own purchase, work
  order, pending cost or pending expense.
- Cross-cutting fixes:
  - idempotent replays of 200 POSTs keep status 200;
  - branch filters use `inArray`;
  - the `patchOf()` helper replaces zod `.partial()`, which wiped the VIN, reset `isSensitive`
    and reactivated branches on PATCH;
  - document numbers use the tenant's timezone year.

## Phase 4 — delivered (backend)
- Migrations 0007/0008:
  - 15 CRM tables, all with RLS;
  - append-only stage history and receipt allocations;
  - receipt and refund amount guards;
  - a btree_gist exclusion constraint that blocks double-booked test drives;
  - the default 8-stage pipeline;
  - the system user for scheduled jobs.
- Finance: ReceiptsService (customer money goes to 2100 through CashService; void is refused once
  the money was used) and RefundsService (request → approve by another user → pay).
- Reservations: the vehicle is locked; deposits are receipts. Cancel per policy forfeits to 4200
  with a reason. Expiry releases the vehicle and keeps the deposit as customer credit (B-021).
  Jobs send reminders and handle expiry.
- Customers:
  - phone normalisation including Arabic digits;
  - national ID encrypted plus a keyed hash, revealed only with permission and audited;
  - duplicate rules (B-023) and rep visibility;
  - 360 view and interaction timeline.
- Leads: LD numbering, a configurable pipeline (copy-on-write defaults, D-021), board,
  follow-ups, an exactly-once reminder job, won/lost/reopen, and assignment by managers.
- Appointments: a shared calendar with private details (D-022), staff and vehicle clash checks,
  test-drive start/finish with licence and odometer checks, timeline entries, reminders.
- Wishes: a pure shared matcher (D-023), a matching job, exactly-once notifications, explain,
  dismiss and for-vehicle.
- Employees and versioned commission policies, never retroactive (D-024); preview uses the shared
  calculator.
- Jobs: advisory-locked per-tenant runner; Notifications: deduplicated inbox.

## Phase 3 review round 2 — fixed (2026-10-17)
- **Concurrency (D-025).** Write transactions of a company now take one advisory lock first. This
  removes the deadlocks between pay-now flows, supplier payments, transfers, allocations and
  opposite-order payments. Acquisition approve takes the reviewed `version` (409 when the
  purchase changed).
- **Authorization.**
  - Accounts-payable reads need `suppliers.read` + `payments.read`, so sales roles no longer see
    purchase prices or AP aging.
  - Voids check the branch of each document.
  - Only all-branch users manage company-level cash accounts. An empty PATCH is a no-op, not a 500.
  - Supplier identity (national ID, tax number) is hidden without `suppliers.read`.
- **Maker-checker.**
  - One maker rule, from the audit trail, covers acquisitions and work orders (item editors are
    makers).
  - The inbox `canDecide` uses that same rule.
  - Vehicle-bound requests follow the vehicle's current branch.

## Phase 5 — delivered (backend)
- Migrations 0009/0010:
  - sales, trade-ins, installment plans/installments/allocations, commissions, sale documents and
    cash day closings, all with RLS;
  - DELETE revoked; installments and allocations immutable;
  - guards that freeze sale terms once confirmed, freeze documents, and protect closings;
  - one live sale per vehicle, one live document per type and sale, one live closing per day.
- Sales: pricing against asking/floor and the seller's discount limit, approval inbox with
  maker-checker, confirmation (frozen terms, trade-ins into stock, deposit transfer, plan,
  expected commission, lead won), delivery rules (B-012), cancellation and returns that unwind
  everything (D-028).
- Installments (D-029): frozen schedule, oldest-first allocation with 2400 → 4100 release, quote
  and early settlement with waiver, reminders job.
- Commissions (D-030), documents and PDFs (D-031), daily cash closing (D-032).
- Spec: `test/sales.spec.ts` (17 scenarios), ledger integrity checked after every test.

## Phase 6 — delivered (backend)
- `GET /dashboard`: inventory, sales (with a 6-month trend), leads, today's appointments, cash,
  receivables and approvals blocks, each behind its permission and the user's branch scope.
- `GET /reports/{inventory,sales,leads,cash-flow,receivables}` return a shared `ReportResult`
  (columns with types, rows, totals, summary, ledger reconciliation, drill-down kind).
- `GET /reports/:key/export?format=csv|xlsx|pdf&locale=ar|en`, with the same filters and
  column policy.
- `PdfService` moved to its own module (PdfModule), used by sale documents and report exports.
- Spec: `test/reports.spec.ts` (10 scenarios).

## Local environment notes (for resumption)
- PostgreSQL 16 local cluster: `service postgresql start`.
- Roles/DBs bootstrapped with `infra/db/bootstrap-roles.sql` (dev passwords in `apps/api/.env`, not committed).
- Dev reset: `cd apps/api && set -a && . ./.env && set +a && node -r @swc-node/register src/db/reset.ts`.
- Platform admin (dev DB): admin@autohub.local / see session notes; tenant `elite-motors` owner owner@elite.test.
