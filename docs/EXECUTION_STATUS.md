# Execution Status

**Current phase:** Phase 4 backend complete and merged; Phase 3 + 4 web pages outstanding, then Phase 5.
**Last completed task (2026-10-17):**
- Phase 4 backend merged into the branch (customers, leads and pipeline, appointments and test
  drives, wishes and matching, reservations, deposits and refunds, notifications, jobs, employees
  and commission policies) and pushed.
- Phase 3 adversarial reviews R2 (concurrency) and R3 (authorization) are done. All 13 findings
  are fixed, and their reproducing specs (`review-concurrency.spec.ts`, `review-authz.spec.ts`)
  now pass.
- Full API suite: 24 files, 264 tests passing. Shared: 42 passing.

**Interrupted by usage limits:**
- The Phase 3 web agents W1–W4 and the web integrator died at the session limit.
- W1 left partial files: `apps/web/src/features/purchasing/` and the `i18n/{approvals,costs,workOrders}.ts`
  files. They are untracked and unverified; review or finish them before committing.

**Exact next tasks:**
1. Phase 3 web: purchasing (acquisitions, suppliers, payables, supplier payments), costs and work
   orders, approvals inbox, cash and expenses, ledger reports. Keep the agents few and large; check
   in the browser (AR and EN).
2. Phase 4 web: customers, leads board, calendar and test drives, reservations and deposits,
   refunds, wishes, notifications, employees and commission policies.
3. Phase 5: sales, contracts, invoices, sale payments, installments, delivery, returns, earned
   commissions, daily cash closing.

## Phase 1 — delivered
- pnpm workspace: `packages/shared`, `apps/api`, `apps/web`, `e2e`.
- DB: migrations `0000_foundation`, `0001_foundation_security` (RLS on all tenant tables, audit hash chain
  trigger, immutable + balanced ledger triggers, gapless numbering function, narrow SECURITY DEFINER helpers).
- API: sessions (hashed tokens, idle+absolute expiry), CSRF (session-bound token + Origin check), argon2id,
  lockout, rate limits, RBAC guard (deny-by-default), per-request tenant transaction, idempotency interceptor,
  provisioning, users/roles/branches/company settings, audit list/verify, health endpoints, OpenAPI at /api/docs.
- Web: design system (light/dark, RTL/LTR), login, company selection, account, platform admin, settings pages.
- CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (not yet observed running on GitHub).

## Phase 2 — delivered
- Migrations 0002/0003: vehicles + catalog (global/tenant RLS), history tables (append-only grants),
  media/documents, inspections (completed = immutable via trigger), transfers, stock counts, trigram search;
  seeded 39 makes / 164 models / 53 features / default inspection template.
- API: Vehicle CRUD (optimistic locking, market-aware VIN rules), lifecycle transitions through one locked entry
  point, pricing with floor permission + history, odometer readings with correction rule, features, media
  (sniffed types, GPS/XMP scrub, primary/public/order), documents (sensitive filtering), inspections (template
  snapshot, required items, completion), transfers (in-transit blocking, destination receipt), stock counts
  (scan/submit/reconcile with write-off), catalog, permission-checked file downloads.
- Web: vehicle grid/table list with filters, sectioned form, Vehicle 360 page with tabs and action modals,
  inspection page with interactive SVG body diagram (colour + letter codes), transfers, stock counts.

## Phase 3 — delivered so far
- Migrations 0004/0005:
  - tables: suppliers, cost categories (25 seeded), acquisitions, vehicle costs, cash accounts, cash
    transactions (append-only), supplier payments with allocations (append-only), expenses, work
    orders and items, approval requests;
  - RLS on all of them;
  - DELETE revoked on financial documents;
  - posted-amount guard triggers.
- FinanceModule (global):
  - CashService: cash book and GL together; transfers and transfer reversal; closed-day hook.
  - CashAccountsService: opening balance against equity (3000).
  - PayablesService.
  - SupplierPaymentsService: exact allocation, no overpayment, void.
  - ApprovalsService: inbox, exact counts, maker-checker guard.
- PurchasingModule:
  - suppliers 360, duplicate check, GL statement;
  - acquisitions: draft → submit → approve/reject → cancel, with pay-on-approval;
  - cost engine: approve, reject, reverse, shared-cost allocation, costs posted after a sale go to
    COGS, summary with expected profit;
  - open payables, and aging reconciled to GL 2000.
- ExpensesModule: post, approve, reject, reverse, pay-now, summaries.
- WorkOrdersModule: approved items become posted costs, exactly once.
- AccountingModule:
  - transfers and reversal, cash book;
  - chart, trial balance, journal, account statement;
  - income statement and balance sheet;
  - reconciliation of cash vs 1100, inventory vs 1300, AP vs 2000.
- B-016 decided conservatively: the creator or submitter cannot approve their own purchase, work
  order, pending cost or pending expense.
- Cross-cutting fixes:
  - idempotent replays of 200 POSTs keep status 200;
  - branch filters use `inArray`;
  - the `patchOf()` helper replaces zod `.partial()`, which wiped the VIN, reset `isSensitive`
    and reactivated branches on PATCH;
  - document numbers use the tenant's timezone year.

## Phase 4 — delivered (backend)
- Migrations 0007/0008:
  - 15 CRM tables, all with RLS;
  - append-only stage history and receipt allocations;
  - receipt and refund amount guards;
  - a btree_gist exclusion constraint that blocks double-booked test drives;
  - the default 8-stage pipeline;
  - the system user for scheduled jobs.
- Finance: ReceiptsService (customer money goes to 2100 through CashService; void is refused once
  the money was used) and RefundsService (request → approve by another user → pay).
- Reservations: the vehicle is locked; deposits are receipts. Cancel per policy forfeits to 4200
  with a reason. Expiry releases the vehicle and keeps the deposit as customer credit (B-021).
  Jobs send reminders and handle expiry.
- Customers:
  - phone normalisation including Arabic digits;
  - national ID encrypted plus a keyed hash, revealed only with permission and audited;
  - duplicate rules (B-023) and rep visibility;
  - 360 view and interaction timeline.
- Leads: LD numbering, a configurable pipeline (copy-on-write defaults, D-021), board,
  follow-ups, an exactly-once reminder job, won/lost/reopen, and assignment by managers.
- Appointments: a shared calendar with private details (D-022), staff and vehicle clash checks,
  test-drive start/finish with licence and odometer checks, timeline entries, reminders.
- Wishes: a pure shared matcher (D-023), a matching job, exactly-once notifications, explain,
  dismiss and for-vehicle.
- Employees and versioned commission policies, never retroactive (D-024); preview uses the shared
  calculator.
- Jobs: advisory-locked per-tenant runner; Notifications: deduplicated inbox.

## Phase 3 review round 2 — fixed (2026-10-17)
- **Concurrency (D-025).** Write transactions of a company now take one advisory lock first. This
  removes the deadlocks between pay-now flows, supplier payments, transfers, allocations and
  opposite-order payments. Acquisition approve takes the reviewed `version` (409 when the
  purchase changed).
- **Authorization.**
  - Accounts-payable reads need `suppliers.read` + `payments.read`, so sales roles no longer see
    purchase prices or AP aging.
  - Voids check the branch of each document.
  - Only all-branch users manage company-level cash accounts. An empty PATCH is a no-op, not a 500.
  - Supplier identity (national ID, tax number) is hidden without `suppliers.read`.
- **Maker-checker.**
  - One maker rule, from the audit trail, covers acquisitions and work orders (item editors are
    makers).
  - The inbox `canDecide` uses that same rule.
  - Vehicle-bound requests follow the vehicle's current branch.

## Local environment notes (for resumption)
- PostgreSQL 16 local cluster: `service postgresql start`.
- Roles/DBs bootstrapped with `infra/db/bootstrap-roles.sql` (dev passwords in `apps/api/.env`, not committed).
- Dev reset: `cd apps/api && set -a && . ./.env && set +a && node -r @swc-node/register src/db/reset.ts`.
- Platform admin (dev DB): admin@autohub.local / see session notes; tenant `elite-motors` owner owner@elite.test.
